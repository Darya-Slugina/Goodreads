        description: `With the same trademark compassion and erudition he brought to The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,
         Oliver Sacks explores the place music occupies in the brain and how it affects the human condition. In Musicophilia,
          he shows us a variety of what he calls “musical misalignments.” Among them: a man struck by lightning who suddenly 
          desires to become a pianist at the age of forty-two; an entire group of children with Williams syndrome, who are hypermusical 
          from birth; people with “amusia,” to whom a symphony sounds like the clattering of pots and pans; and a man whose memory
           spans only seven seconds-for everything but music. Illuminating, inspiring, and utterly unforgettable, Musicophilia is 
           Oliver Sacks’ latest masterpiece. `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `We Play Ourselves is a story about theatre, art, sexuality, and relationships. Full review to come,
                   but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                   funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main 
                   characters and I can’t wait to read more by the author. I read this book in one sitting—very fast paced.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `Whether you load your iPod with Bach or Bono, music has a significant role in your life—even if you never
         realized it. Why does music evoke such powerful moods? The answers are at last be- coming clear, thanks to revolutionary
          neuroscience and the emerging field of evolutionary psychology. Both a cutting-edge study and a tribute to the beauty
           of music itself, This Is Your Brain on Music unravels a host of mysteries that affect everything from pop culture to
            our understanding of human nature, including:
        • Are our musical preferences shaped in utero?
        • Is there a cutoff point for acquiring new tastes in music?
        • What do PET scans and MRIs reveal about the brain’s response to music?
        • Is musical pleasure different from other kinds of pleasure?
        
        This Is Your Brain on Music explores cultures in which singing is considered an essential human function, patients who have
         a rare disorder that prevents them from making sense of music, and scientists studying why two people may not have the same
          definition of pitch. At every turn, this provocative work unlocks deep secrets about how nature and nurture forge a uniquely human obsession.`,

                review: `our first bsc graphic novel with new artist gabriela epstein! like with the transition from raina 
                    telgemeier to gale galligan, this transition isn't quite seamless, but is close enough to fool most kids. 
                    the book was just as subtexty (claudia x ashley = clashley) as the source material, but I can't pretend 
                    I wasn't hoping for the gayness to be explicit rather than implied.`,
                hiddenReview: `three notes about the adaptation that are worth mentioning: first, though everyone still 
                    makes fun of ashley's style, she's much more alternative/punk than the described boho style in the original
                     book. secondly, there is one two-page spread where ashley's face is smack dab in the middle of the panel, 
                     so we lose her facial expression (a mistake that, I suspect, epstein will probably not make again). thirdly,
                     in the scene where claud makes rice krispies treats with the rodowskys, the actual recipe is included, which is a really lovely touch!`

                review: `This is one of my favorite books, so I'm happy that the graphic novel is extremely faithful to the
                     source material. I like the character design of Ashley; her edgy style felt like a good update of the 1980s
                      "hippie". I enjoyed the way this brings the story to life. Claudia and Ashley's "finding source material" 
                      montage is funny and relatable, Jackie Rodowsky is sweet and winning, and Ashley's abstract fire hydrant sculpture is cool.`,
                hiddenReview: `I was sort of hoping against hope that the queer subtext in this book would be made text in the update, and it's 
                      not, but it's also not toned down. It includes one of my favorite moments: when Claudia tells Mimi she just met a girl who she 
                      somehow thinks will be a good friend, and Mimi remarks that it happens that way sometimes - it happened that way with Claudia's
                       grandfather. I felt the exact same way when I, at twelve, first met the cool edgy-style artist who would eventually become my 
                       first queer significant other, so that moment/this book was very important to me.`

                review: `Gabriela Epstein had some big shoes to fill, joining the BSC Graphic Novel series nine books in,
                     and I'll be honest, it took me a couple chapters to really warm up to her art. Not that it's a huge departure 
                     from what we've already seen, but it's still a little different and change is scary haha. But her cherubic angel 
                     Jackie Rodowsky won me over, and made me notice how great everyone looks. For some reason, I was especially drawn 
                     to Kristy and Dawn. I'm excited to see the next book she adapts!`,
                hiddenReview: `Story-wise, I enjoyed this. It's been a couple of years since I last read the original (which is embarrassing,
                    since I thought I would get through the whole series in, like, a couple months lmao) but as far as I can tell, it was a
                    pretty faithful adaption. I especially liked the salty BSC eating all her snacks, that was a fun little montage (especially
                    Mary Anne catching the marshmallow thrown by Kristy in her mouth ahhahahaha!!) Oh, and the one panel of all their
                    identical angry faces (except Mary Anne's sympathetic one) cracked me up!I can see this book being just as popular 
                    as the rest of the series, and hope that we get many, many more books. (Hey, Raina and Gale each got four, so it's 
                    only fair for Gaby and Chan Chau (who is adapting the next book) to also each get four. BSC FOREVER!!!)`,

        description: `Kim Gordon, founding member of Sonic Youth, fashion icon, and role model for a generation of women,
         now tells her story—a memoir of life as an artist, of music, marriage, motherhood, independence, and as one of the
          first women of rock and roll, written with the lyricism and haunting beauty of Patti Smith's Just Kids.

        Often described as aloof, Kim Gordon opens up as never before in Girl in a Band. Telling the story of her family,
         growing up in California in the '60s and '70s, her life in visual art, her move to New York City, the men in her
          life, her marriage, her relationship with her daughter, her music, and her band, Girl in a Band is a rich and beautifully written memoir.
        
        Gordon takes us back to the lost New York of the 1980s and '90s that gave rise to Sonic Youth, and the Alternative
         revolution in popular music. The band helped build a vocabulary of music—paving the way for Nirvana, Hole, Smashing
          Pumpkins and many other acts. But at its core, Girl in a Band examines the route from girl to woman in uncharted 
          territory, music, art career, what partnership means—and what happens when that identity dissolves.
        
        Evocative and edgy, filled with the sights and sounds of a changing world and a transformative life, Girl in a Band
         is the fascinating chronicle of a remarkable journey and an extraordinary artist.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.

                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                   but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        Never borrow pants from your brother. Especially if he’s a size smaller than you are, because all that pressure
         in the junk will short-circuit your brain.
        
        And you’ll lie to a woman in a club about your real name.
        
        Leave her unsatisfied after making out in a bathroom.
        
        Then find out that she’s the one thing standing in the way of your dreams. And she very much doesn’t like being lied to.
        
        Now I have to convince Lila Valentine—the woman I can’t stop thinking about, my biggest regret, and my new boss—that
         I’m what’s best for the baseball team she’s inherited.
        
        If we can’t work together to save the Fireballs, the commissioner’s forcing a sale and moving them across the country.
        
        I’ll do anything to save my home team.
        
        But the one thing I can’t do?
        
        Keep my hands to myself.
        
        Which would be fine, if she hadn’t been telling me lies this whole time too. `,

                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,

                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,

                review: `I really don't know how to review this book, I just want to tell everyone to read it and let it sink in. 
                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `The highly anticipated spoken word poetry collection from Lana Del Rey, Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass

        “'Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass' is the title poem of the book and the first poem 
        I wrote of many. Some of which came to me in their entirety, which I dictated and then typed
         out, and some that I worked laboriously picking apart each word to make the perfect poem. They
          are eclectic and honest and not trying to be anything other than what they are and for that reason
           I’m proud of them, especially because the spirit in which they were written was very authentic.” (Lana Del Rey)
        
        Lana Del Rey brings her breathtaking poetry to life in an unprecedented audiobook. In this stunning spoken word performance,
         Lana Del Rey reads 14 poems from her debut book Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass accompanied by music from Grammy 
         Award-winning musician Jack Antonoff. Lana’s debut book solidifies her further as “the essential writer of her times”
          (The Atlantic). This audiobook features Lana reading select poems from the book, including "LA Who Am I to Love You?",
           "The Land of 1,000 Fires", "Past the Bushes Cypress Thriving", "Never to Heaven", "Tessa DiPietro", "Happy", and several others.
            The result is an extraordinary poetic landscape that reflects the unguarded spirit of its creator.  `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                   but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

         of exquisite harps - but not a great maker of conversation. He’s content in his own company, quietly working and away 
         from social situations that he doesn’t always get right.

        But one day, a cherry-socked woman stumbles across his barn and the conversation flows a little more easily than usual.
         She says her name’s Ellie, a housewife, alone, out on her daily walk and, though she doesn’t say this, she looks sad. 
         He wants to make her feel better, so he gives her one of his harps, made of cherry wood.

                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.

                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and

                   but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                   funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main 
                   characters and I can’t wait to read more by the author. I read this book in one sitting—very fast paced.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `Auschwitz, 1943: In the depths of hell, can hope rise? And can love triumph over hatred?

        Based on the unforgettable true story of Alma Rosé, The Violinist of Auschwitz brings to life one of history’s most fearless,
         inspiring and courageous heroines. Alma’s bravery saved countless lives, bringing hope to those who had forgotten its meaning…
        
        In Auschwitz, every day is a fight for survival. Alma is inmate 50381, the number tattooed on her skin in pale blue ink. She is
        
        cooped up with thousands of others, torn from loved ones, trapped in a maze of barbed wire. Every day people disappear, never to be seen again.
        
        This tragic reality couldn’t be further from Alma’s previous life. An esteemed violinist, her performances left her audiences 
        spellbound. But when the Nazis descend on Europe, none of that can save her…
        
        When the head of the women’s camp appoints Alma as the conductor of the orchestra, performing for prisoners trudging to work
         as well as the highest-ranking Nazis, Alma refuses: “they can kill me but they won’t make me play”. Yet she soon realizes the
         
         
         power this position offers: she can provide starving girls with extra rations and save many from the clutches of death.
        
        This is how Alma meets Miklos, a talented pianist. Surrounded by despair, they find happiness in joint rehearsals, secret notes,
         and concerts they give side by side––all the while praying that this will one day end. But in Auschwitz, the very air is tainted
         
         with loss, and tragedy is the only certainty… In such a hopeless place, can their love survive?
        
        This devastatingly heartbreaking yet beautifully hopeful tale proves that even in the darkest of days, love can prevail––and give
         you something to live for. Fans of The Choice, The Tattooist of Auschwitz and The Orphan Train will lose their hearts to this magnificent tale. `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some

         Elizabeth Acevedo and Jason Reynolds!
        Be bold. Get seen. Be Heard.
        
        For seventeen-year-old Denver, music is everything. Writing, performing, and her ultimate goal: escaping her
         very small, very white hometown.
        
        So Denver is more than ready on the day she and her best friends Dali and Shak sing their way into the orbit
         of the biggest R&B star in the world, Sean "Mercury" Ellis. Merc gives them everything: parties, perks, wild
          nights -- plus hours and hours in the recording studio. Even the painful sacrifices and the lies the girls have to tell are all worth it.
        
        Until they're not.
        
        Denver begins to realize that she's trapped in Merc's world, struggling to hold on to her own voice. As the
         dream turns into a nightmare, she must make a choice: lose her big break, or get broken.
        
        Inspired by true events, Muted is a fearless exploration of the dark side of the music industry, the business
         of exploitation, how a girl's dreams can be used against her -- and what it takes to fight back.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

        description: `For fans of Josie Silver and Emily Henry comes a debut romcom about the life-changing magic of second chances.

        Zoë Frixos gets the whole love song thing. Truly, she does. As an editor at a major music magazine in London, it's part of
         her job description. But love? Let's just say Zoë's been a bit off-beat in that department. After falling hard for her best
          friend, Simon, at thirteen and missing every chance to tell him how she felt before he left town, Zoë came to one grand conclusion: Love stinks.
        
        Twenty years later, Simon is returning to London, newly single and as charming as ever, and Zoë vows to take her second chance.
         But Zoë's got other problems now: In order to save her magazine from closure, she has to land the biggest interview of her career
          with a notoriously elusive rock idol. There's just one problem: Nick, the arrogant publicist who seems determined to stop the 
          story and ruin Zoë's life.
        
        With her brother's big(ish) fat(ish) Greek wedding on the horizon, Zoë begins to wonder if her first love is the right love. In 
        the wake of a life-changing choice, Zoë must decide if she's right to be skeptical about love, or if it's time to change her tune... `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                   but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                   funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `From the New York Times-bestselling author of Stony the Road and one of our most important voices on the African-American 
        experience, a powerful new history of the Black church in America as the Black community's abiding rock and its fortress.

        The companion book to the upcoming PBS series.
        
        For the young Henry Louis Gates, Jr., growing up in a small, segregated West Virginia town, the church was his family and his 
        community's true center of gravity. Within those walls, voices were lifted up in song to call forth the best in each other, and 
        to comfort each other when times were at their worst. In this book, his tender and magisterial reckoning with the meaning of 
        the Black church in American history, Gates takes us from his own experience onto a journey across more than four hundred years 
        and spanning the entire country. At road's end, we emerge with a new understanding of the centrality of the Black church to the
         American story--as a cultural and political force, as the center of resistance to slavery and white supremacy, as an unparalleled 
         incubator of talent, and as a crucible for working through the community's most important issues, down to today.`,

                review: `our first bsc graphic novel with new artist gabriela epstein! like with the transition from raina 
                    telgemeier to gale galligan, this transition isn't quite seamless, but is close enough to fool most kids. 
                    the book was just as subtexty (claudia x ashley = clashley) as the source material, but I can't pretend 
                    I wasn't hoping for the gayness to be explicit rather than implied.`,
                hiddenReview: `three notes about the adaptation that are worth mentioning: first, though everyone still 
                    makes fun of ashley's style, she's much more alternative/punk than the described boho style in the original
                     book. secondly, there is one two-page spread where ashley's face is smack dab in the middle of the panel, 
                     so we lose her facial expression (a mistake that, I suspect, epstein will probably not make again). thirdly,
                     in the scene where claud makes rice krispies treats with the rodowskys, the actual recipe is included, which is a really lovely touch!`

                review: `This is one of my favorite books, so I'm happy that the graphic novel is extremely faithful to the
                     source material. I like the character design of Ashley; her edgy style felt like a good update of the 1980s
                      "hippie". I enjoyed the way this brings the story to life. Claudia and Ashley's "finding source material" 
                      montage is funny and relatable, Jackie Rodowsky is sweet and winning, and Ashley's abstract fire hydrant sculpture is cool.`,
                hiddenReview: `I was sort of hoping against hope that the queer subtext in this book would be made text in the update, and it's 
                      not, but it's also not toned down. It includes one of my favorite moments: when Claudia tells Mimi she just met a girl who she 
                      somehow thinks will be a good friend, and Mimi remarks that it happens that way sometimes - it happened that way with Claudia's
                       grandfather. I felt the exact same way when I, at twelve, first met the cool edgy-style artist who would eventually become my 
                       first queer significant other, so that moment/this book was very important to me.`

                review: `Gabriela Epstein had some big shoes to fill, joining the BSC Graphic Novel series nine books in,
                     and I'll be honest, it took me a couple chapters to really warm up to her art. Not that it's a huge departure 
                     from what we've already seen, but it's still a little different and change is scary haha. But her cherubic angel 
                     Jackie Rodowsky won me over, and made me notice how great everyone looks. For some reason, I was especially drawn 
                     to Kristy and Dawn. I'm excited to see the next book she adapts!`,
                hiddenReview: `Story-wise, I enjoyed this. It's been a couple of years since I last read the original (which is embarrassing,
                    since I thought I would get through the whole series in, like, a couple months lmao) but as far as I can tell, it was a
                    pretty faithful adaption. I especially liked the salty BSC eating all her snacks, that was a fun little montage (especially
                    Mary Anne catching the marshmallow thrown by Kristy in her mouth ahhahahaha!!) Oh, and the one panel of all their
                    identical angry faces (except Mary Anne's sympathetic one) cracked me up!I can see this book being just as popular 
                    as the rest of the series, and hope that we get many, many more books. (Hey, Raina and Gale each got four, so it's 
                    only fair for Gaby and Chan Chau (who is adapting the next book) to also each get four. BSC FOREVER!!!)`,

        description: `After a humiliating scandal, a young writer flees to the West Coast to start over, where she is drawn into 
              the morally-ambiguous orbit of a charismatic filmmaker and the teenage girls who are her next subjects.
              Not too long ago, Cass was a promising young playwright in New York, hailed as "a fierce new voice" and "queer, feminist,
               and ready to spill the tea." But at the height of all this attention, Cass finds herself at the center of a searing public 
               shaming, and flees to Los Angeles to escape--and reinvent herself.There she meets her next - door neighbor Caroline, a 
               magnetic filmmaker on the rise, as well as the pack of teenage girls who hang around her house.They are the subjects of 
               Caroline's next semidocumentary movie, which follows the girls' clandestine after - school activity: a Fight Club inspired by
                the violent classic.
              As Cass is drawn into the film's orbit, she is awed by Caroline's drive and confidence.But over time, she becomes troubled by
               how deeply Caroline is manipulating the teens in the name of art--especially as the consequences become increasingly disturbing.
               With her past proving hard to shake and her future one she's no longer sure she wants, Cass is forced to reckon with her own 
               ambitions and confront what she has come to believe about the steep price of success.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

                review: `our first bsc graphic novel with new artist gabriela epstein! like with the transition from raina 
                      telgemeier to gale galligan, this transition isn't quite seamless, but is close enough to fool most kids. 
                      the book was just as subtexty (claudia x ashley = clashley) as the source material, but I can't pretend 
                      I wasn't hoping for the gayness to be explicit rather than implied.`,
                hiddenReview: `three notes about the adaptation that are worth mentioning: first, though everyone still 
                      makes fun of ashley's style, she's much more alternative/punk than the described boho style in the original
                       book. secondly, there is one two-page spread where ashley's face is smack dab in the middle of the panel, 
                       so we lose her facial expression (a mistake that, I suspect, epstein will probably not make again). thirdly,
                       in the scene where claud makes rice krispies treats with the rodowskys, the actual recipe is included, which is a really lovely touch!`

                review: `This is one of my favorite books, so I'm happy that the graphic novel is extremely faithful to the
                       source material. I like the character design of Ashley; her edgy style felt like a good update of the 1980s
                        "hippie". I enjoyed the way this brings the story to life. Claudia and Ashley's "finding source material" 
                        montage is funny and relatable, Jackie Rodowsky is sweet and winning, and Ashley's abstract fire hydrant sculpture is cool.`,
                hiddenReview: `I was sort of hoping against hope that the queer subtext in this book would be made text in the update, and it's 
                        not, but it's also not toned down. It includes one of my favorite moments: when Claudia tells Mimi she just met a girl who she 
                        somehow thinks will be a good friend, and Mimi remarks that it happens that way sometimes - it happened that way with Claudia's
                         grandfather. I felt the exact same way when I, at twelve, first met the cool edgy-style artist who would eventually become my 
                         first queer significant other, so that moment/this book was very important to me.`

                review: `Gabriela Epstein had some big shoes to fill, joining the BSC Graphic Novel series nine books in,
                       and I'll be honest, it took me a couple chapters to really warm up to her art. Not that it's a huge departure 
                       from what we've already seen, but it's still a little different and change is scary haha. But her cherubic angel 
                       Jackie Rodowsky won me over, and made me notice how great everyone looks. For some reason, I was especially drawn 
                       to Kristy and Dawn. I'm excited to see the next book she adapts!`,
                hiddenReview: `Story-wise, I enjoyed this. It's been a couple of years since I last read the original (which is embarrassing,
                      since I thought I would get through the whole series in, like, a couple months lmao) but as far as I can tell, it was a
                      pretty faithful adaption. I especially liked the salty BSC eating all her snacks, that was a fun little montage (especially
                      Mary Anne catching the marshmallow thrown by Kristy in her mouth ahhahahaha!!) Oh, and the one panel of all their
                      identical angry faces (except Mary Anne's sympathetic one) cracked me up!I can see this book being just as popular 
                      as the rest of the series, and hope that we get many, many more books. (Hey, Raina and Gale each got four, so it's 
                      only fair for Gaby and Chan Chau (who is adapting the next book) to also each get four. BSC FOREVER!!!)`,

        description: `A revelatory exploration of fashion through the ages that asks what our clothing reveals
               about ourselves and our society.

              Dress codes are as old as clothing itself. For centuries, clothing has been a wearable status symbol;
               fashion, a weapon in struggles for social change; and dress codes, a way to maintain political control.
                Merchants who dressed like princes and butchers’ wives wearing gem-encrusted crowns were public enemies
                 in medieval societies structured by social hierarchy and defined by spectacle. In Tudor England, silk,
                  velvet, and fur were reserved for the nobility and ballooning pants called “trunk hose” could be considered
                   a menace to good order. The Renaissance era Florentine patriarch Cosimo de Medici captured the power of
                    fashion and dress codes when he remarked, “One can make a gentleman from two yards of red cloth.” Dress
                     codes evolved along with the social and political ideals of the day, but they always reflected struggles
                      for power and status. In the 1700s, South Carolina’s “Negro Act” made it illegal for Black people to dress 
                      “above their condition.” In the 1920s, the bobbed hair and form-fitting dresses worn by free-spirited 
                      flappers were banned in workplaces throughout the United States and in the 1940s the baggy zoot suits 
                      favored by Black and Latino men caused riots in cities from coast to coast.
              
              Even in today’s more informal world, dress codes still determine what we wear, when we wear it—and what our 
              clothing means. People lose their jobs for wearing braided hair, long fingernails, large earrings, beards, and 
              tattoos or refusing to wear a suit and tie or make-up and high heels. In some cities, wearing sagging pants is
               a crime. And even when there are no written rules, implicit dress codes still influence opportunities and social 
               mobility. Silicon Valley CEOs wear t-shirts and flip flops, setting the tone for an entire industry: women wearing
                fashionable dresses or high heels face ridicule in the tech world and some venture capitalists refuse to invest in
                 any company run by someone wearing a suit.
              
              In Dress Codes, law professor and cultural critic Richard Thompson Ford presents an insightful and entertaining
               history of the laws of fashion from the middle ages to the present day, a walk down history’s red carpet to uncover
                and examine the canons, mores, and customs of clothing—rules that we often take for granted. After reading Dress Codes,
                 you’ll never think of fashion as superficial again—and getting dressed will never be the same.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                     but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

        description: `The New York Times-bestselling author of Find Me and Call Me by Your Name returns to the essay form with his
               collection of thoughts on time, the creative mind, and great lives and works

              Irrealis moods are the set of verbal moods that indicate that something is not actually the case or a certain situation
               or action is not known to have happened . . .
              
              Andr� Aciman returns to the essay form in Homo Irrealis to explore what the present tense means to artists who cannot
               grasp the here and now. Irrealis is not about the present, or the past, or the future, but about what might have been
                but never was--but could in theory still happen.
              
              From meditations on subway poetry and the temporal resonances of an empty Italian street, to considerations of the lives
               and work of Sigmund Freud, Constantine Cavafy, W. G. Sebald, John Sloan, �ric Rohmer, Marcel Proust, and Fernando Pessoa,
                and portraits of cities such as Alexandria and St. Petersburg, Homo Irrealis is a deep reflection of the imagination's power
                 to shape our memories under time's seemingly intractable hold.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                     but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                     funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                review: `I really don't know how to review this book, I just want to tell everyone to read it and let it sink in. 
                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `Celebrated author Carole Boston Weatherford and illustrator Floyd Cooper provide a powerful
               look at the Tulsa Race Massacre, one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our nation's history.
                The book traces the history of African Americans in Tulsa's Greenwood district and chronicles the 
                devastation that occurred in 1921 when a white mob attacked the Black community.

              News of what happened was largely suppressed, and no official investigation occurred for seventy-five years. 
              This picture book sensitively introduces young readers to this tragedy and concludes with a call for a better future. `,

                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                review: `I really don't know how to review this book, I just want to tell everyone to read it and let it sink in. 
                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `A groundbreaking and endlessly surprising history of how artisans created America, from
               the nation's origins to the present day.

              At the center of the United States' economic and social development, according to conventional wisdom,
               are industry, commodities, and technology-while craftspeople and handmade objects are relegated to a 
               bygone past. Renowned craft historian Glenn Adamson turns that narrative on its head in this innovative 
               account, revealing how makers have always been central to America's identity. Examine any phase of the 
               nation's struggle to define itself, and artisans are there-from the silversmith Paul Revere and the 
               revolutionary carpenters and blacksmiths who hurled tea into Boston Harbor, to today's “craftivists.” 
               From Mother Jones to Rosie the Riveter. From Betsy Ross to the AIDS Quilt.
              
              Adamson documents how craft has long been implicated in debates around inequality, education, and class, 
              as well as America's failures to live up to its loftiest ideals. Yet artisanship has also been a site of 
              resistance for oppressed people, such as enslaved African-Americans whose skilled labor might confer hard-won 
              agency under bondage, or the Native American makers who built traditional arts into businesses that preserved
               cherished folkways. Theirs are among the array of memorable portraits of Americans both celebrated and unfamiliar 
               in this richly peopled book. As Adamson argues, these artisans' stories speak to our collective striving toward
                a more perfect union: from the beginning, America had to be-and still remains to be-crafted. `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:

                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have

                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked

        description: `A decade in the making: the first comprehensive look at the life and art of Francis Bacon,
               one of the iconic painters of the twentieth century--from the Pulitzer Prize-winning authors of de Kooning:
                An American Master.

              Francis Bacon created an indelible image of mankind in modern times, and played an outsized role in both 
              twentieth century art and life--from his public emergence with his legendary Triptych 1944 (its images so
                   unrelievedly awful that people fled the gallery), to his death in Madrid in 1992.
              
              Bacon was a witty free spirit and unabashed homosexual at a time when many others remained closeted, and his
               exploits were as unforgettable as his images. He moved among the worlds of London's Soho and East End, the
                literary salons of London and Paris, and the homosexual life of Tangier. Through hundreds of interviews, 
                and extensive new research, the authors probe Bacon's childhood in Ireland (he earned his father's lasting
                 disdain because his asthma prevented him from hunting); his increasingly open homosexuality; his early design 
                 career--never before explored in detail; the formation of his vision; his early failure as an artist; his
                  uneasy relationship with American abstract art; and his improbable late emergence onto the international
                   stage as one of the great visionaries of the twentieth century. In all, Francis Bacon: Revelations gives
                    us a more complete and nuanced--and more international--portrait than ever before of this singularly private,
                     darkly funny, eruptive man and his equally eruptive, extraordinary art. Bacon was not just an influential 
                     artist, he helped remake the twentieth-century figure. `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                     but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                     but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                     funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main 
                     characters and I can’t wait to read more by the author. I read this book in one sitting—very fast paced.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 2014

              Aged thirteen, Theo Decker, son of a devoted mother and a reckless, largely absent father, survives an accident
               that otherwise tears his life apart. Alone and rudderless in New York, he is taken in by the family of a wealthy
                friend. He is tormented by an unbearable longing for his mother, and down the years clings to the thing that
                 most reminds him of her: a small, strangely captivating painting that ultimately draws him into the criminal
                  underworld. As he grows up, Theo learns to glide between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty antiques
                   store where he works. He is alienated and in love - and his talisman, the painting, places him at the centre
                    of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.
              
              The Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through present-day America and a drama of enthralling power. Combining
               unforgettably vivid characters and thrilling suspense, it is a beautiful, addictive triumph - a sweeping story
                of loss and obsession, of survival and self-invention, of the deepest mysteries of love, identity and fate.`,

                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,

                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `A short, powerful, illustrated book written by Khaled Hosseini in response to the current refugee crisis,
           Sea Prayer is composed in the form of a letter, from a father to his son, on the eve of their journey. Watching over his
            sleeping son, the father reflects on the dangerous sea-crossing that lies before them. It is also a vivid portrait of
             their life in Homs, Syria, before the war, and of that city's swift transformation from a home into a deadly war zone.

          Impelled to write this story by the haunting image of young Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed
           upon the beach in Turkey in September 2015, Hosseini hopes to pay tribute to the millions of families, like Kurdi's,
            who have been splintered and forced from home by war and persecution, and he will donate author proceeds from this book
             to the UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency) and The Khaled Hosseini Foundation to help fund lifesaving relief efforts to help 
             refugees around the globe. Hosseini is also a Goodwill Envoy to the UNHCR, and the founder of The Khaled Hosseini Foundation,
              a nonprofit that provides humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                 to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                 own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                 like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                 waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                the whole book.
                I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                 better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                 but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                 at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                  more than the ending we get.
                In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                 but she is clearly a talented writer.
                An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                 she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                 by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                 Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                 will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                 believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                 than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                  Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                   exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                   lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                 a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

        description: `With the same trademark compassion and erudition he brought to The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,
         Oliver Sacks explores the place music occupies in the brain and how it affects the human condition. In Musicophilia,
          he shows us a variety of what he calls “musical misalignments.” Among them: a man struck by lightning who suddenly 
          desires to become a pianist at the age of forty-two; an entire group of children with Williams syndrome, who are hypermusical 
          from birth; people with “amusia,” to whom a symphony sounds like the clattering of pots and pans; and a man whose memory
           spans only seven seconds-for everything but music. Illuminating, inspiring, and utterly unforgettable, Musicophilia is 
           Oliver Sacks’ latest masterpiece. `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `We Play Ourselves is a story about theatre, art, sexuality, and relationships. Full review to come,
                   but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                   funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main 
                   characters and I can’t wait to read more by the author. I read this book in one sitting—very fast paced.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `Whether you load your iPod with Bach or Bono, music has a significant role in your life—even if you never
         realized it. Why does music evoke such powerful moods? The answers are at last be- coming clear, thanks to revolutionary
          neuroscience and the emerging field of evolutionary psychology. Both a cutting-edge study and a tribute to the beauty
           of music itself, This Is Your Brain on Music unravels a host of mysteries that affect everything from pop culture to
            our understanding of human nature, including:
        • Are our musical preferences shaped in utero?
        • Is there a cutoff point for acquiring new tastes in music?
        • What do PET scans and MRIs reveal about the brain’s response to music?
        • Is musical pleasure different from other kinds of pleasure?
        
        This Is Your Brain on Music explores cultures in which singing is considered an essential human function, patients who have
         a rare disorder that prevents them from making sense of music, and scientists studying why two people may not have the same
          definition of pitch. At every turn, this provocative work unlocks deep secrets about how nature and nurture forge a uniquely human obsession.`,

                review: `our first bsc graphic novel with new artist gabriela epstein! like with the transition from raina 
                    telgemeier to gale galligan, this transition isn't quite seamless, but is close enough to fool most kids. 
                    the book was just as subtexty (claudia x ashley = clashley) as the source material, but I can't pretend 
                    I wasn't hoping for the gayness to be explicit rather than implied.`,
                hiddenReview: `three notes about the adaptation that are worth mentioning: first, though everyone still 
                    makes fun of ashley's style, she's much more alternative/punk than the described boho style in the original
                     book. secondly, there is one two-page spread where ashley's face is smack dab in the middle of the panel, 
                     so we lose her facial expression (a mistake that, I suspect, epstein will probably not make again). thirdly,
                     in the scene where claud makes rice krispies treats with the rodowskys, the actual recipe is included, which is a really lovely touch!`

                     source material. I like the character design of Ashley; her edgy style felt like a good update of the 1980s
                      "hippie". I enjoyed the way this brings the story to life. Claudia and Ashley's "finding source material" 
                      montage is funny and relatable, Jackie Rodowsky is sweet and winning, and Ashley's abstract fire hydrant sculpture is cool.`,

                      not, but it's also not toned down. It includes one of my favorite moments: when Claudia tells Mimi she just met a girl who she 
                      somehow thinks will be a good friend, and Mimi remarks that it happens that way sometimes - it happened that way with Claudia's
                       grandfather. I felt the exact same way when I, at twelve, first met the cool edgy-style artist who would eventually become my 
                       first queer significant other, so that moment/this book was very important to me.`

                     and I'll be honest, it took me a couple chapters to really warm up to her art. Not that it's a huge departure 
                     from what we've already seen, but it's still a little different and change is scary haha. But her cherubic angel 
                     Jackie Rodowsky won me over, and made me notice how great everyone looks. For some reason, I was especially drawn

                    pretty faithful adaption. I especially liked the salty BSC eating all her snacks, that was a fun little montage (especially

                    as the rest of the series, and hope that we get many, many more books. (Hey, Raina and Gale each got four, so it's 
                    only fair for Gaby and Chan Chau (who is adapting the next book) to also each get four. BSC FOREVER!!!)`,

        description: `Kim Gordon, founding member of Sonic Youth, fashion icon, and role model for a generation of women,
         now tells her story—a memoir of life as an artist, of music, marriage, motherhood, independence, and as one of the
          first women of rock and roll, written with the lyricism and haunting beauty of Patti Smith's Just Kids.

        Often described as aloof, Kim Gordon opens up as never before in Girl in a Band. Telling the story of her family,
         growing up in California in the '60s and '70s, her life in visual art, her move to New York City, the men in her
          life, her marriage, her relationship with her daughter, her music, and her band, Girl in a Band is a rich and beautifully written memoir.
        
        Gordon takes us back to the lost New York of the 1980s and '90s that gave rise to Sonic Youth, and the Alternative
         revolution in popular music. The band helped build a vocabulary of music—paving the way for Nirvana, Hole, Smashing
          Pumpkins and many other acts. But at its core, Girl in a Band examines the route from girl to woman in uncharted 
          territory, music, art career, what partnership means—and what happens when that identity dissolves.
        
        Evocative and edgy, filled with the sights and sounds of a changing world and a transformative life, Girl in a Band
         is the fascinating chronicle of a remarkable journey and an extraordinary artist.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.

                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                   but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                   funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main 
                   characters and I can’t wait to read more by the author. I read this book in one sitting—very fast paced.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                review: `I really don't know how to review this book, I just want to tell everyone to read it and let it sink in. 
                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `The lies will come back to bite you every time...

        Never borrow pants from your brother. Especially if he’s a size smaller than you are, because all that pressure
         in the junk will short-circuit your brain.
        
        And you’ll lie to a woman in a club about your real name.
        
        Leave her unsatisfied after making out in a bathroom.
        
        Then find out that she’s the one thing standing in the way of your dreams. And she very much doesn’t like being lied to.
        
        Now I have to convince Lila Valentine—the woman I can’t stop thinking about, my biggest regret, and my new boss—that
         I’m what’s best for the baseball team she’s inherited.
        
        If we can’t work together to save the Fireballs, the commissioner’s forcing a sale and moving them across the country.
        
        I’ll do anything to save my home team.
        
        But the one thing I can’t do?
        
        Keep my hands to myself.
        
        Which would be fine, if she hadn’t been telling me lies this whole time too. `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `The highly anticipated spoken word poetry collection from Lana Del Rey, Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass

        “'Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass' is the title poem of the book and the first poem 
        I wrote of many. Some of which came to me in their entirety, which I dictated and then typed
         out, and some that I worked laboriously picking apart each word to make the perfect poem. They
          are eclectic and honest and not trying to be anything other than what they are and for that reason
           I’m proud of them, especially because the spirit in which they were written was very authentic.” (Lana Del Rey)
        
        Lana Del Rey brings her breathtaking poetry to life in an unprecedented audiobook. In this stunning spoken word performance,
         Lana Del Rey reads 14 poems from her debut book Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass accompanied by music from Grammy 
         Award-winning musician Jack Antonoff. Lana’s debut book solidifies her further as “the essential writer of her times”
          (The Atlantic). This audiobook features Lana reading select poems from the book, including "LA Who Am I to Love You?",
           "The Land of 1,000 Fires", "Past the Bushes Cypress Thriving", "Never to Heaven", "Tessa DiPietro", "Happy", and several others.
            The result is an extraordinary poetic landscape that reflects the unguarded spirit of its creator.  `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                   but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                   funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                review: `I really don't know how to review this book, I just want to tell everyone to read it and let it sink in. 
                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `Auschwitz, 1943: In the depths of hell, can hope rise? And can love triumph over hatred?

        Based on the unforgettable true story of Alma Rosé, The Violinist of Auschwitz brings to life one of history’s most fearless,
         inspiring and courageous heroines. Alma’s bravery saved countless lives, bringing hope to those who had forgotten its meaning…
        
        In Auschwitz, every day is a fight for survival. Alma is inmate 50381, the number tattooed on her skin in pale blue ink. She is
        
        cooped up with thousands of others, torn from loved ones, trapped in a maze of barbed wire. Every day people disappear, never to be seen again.
        
        This tragic reality couldn’t be further from Alma’s previous life. An esteemed violinist, her performances left her audiences 
        spellbound. But when the Nazis descend on Europe, none of that can save her…
        
        When the head of the women’s camp appoints Alma as the conductor of the orchestra, performing for prisoners trudging to work
         as well as the highest-ranking Nazis, Alma refuses: “they can kill me but they won’t make me play”. Yet she soon realizes the
         
         
         power this position offers: she can provide starving girls with extra rations and save many from the clutches of death.
        
        This is how Alma meets Miklos, a talented pianist. Surrounded by despair, they find happiness in joint rehearsals, secret notes,
         and concerts they give side by side––all the while praying that this will one day end. But in Auschwitz, the very air is tainted
         
         with loss, and tragedy is the only certainty… In such a hopeless place, can their love survive?
        
        This devastatingly heartbreaking yet beautifully hopeful tale proves that even in the darkest of days, love can prevail––and give
         you something to live for. Fans of The Choice, The Tattooist of Auschwitz and The Orphan Train will lose their hearts to this magnificent tale. `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better

                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold

         Elizabeth Acevedo and Jason Reynolds!
        Be bold. Get seen. Be Heard.
        
        For seventeen-year-old Denver, music is everything. Writing, performing, and her ultimate goal: escaping her
         very small, very white hometown.
        
        So Denver is more than ready on the day she and her best friends Dali and Shak sing their way into the orbit
         of the biggest R&B star in the world, Sean "Mercury" Ellis. Merc gives them everything: parties, perks, wild
          nights -- plus hours and hours in the recording studio. Even the painful sacrifices and the lies the girls have to tell are all worth it.
        
        Until they're not.
        
        Denver begins to realize that she's trapped in Merc's world, struggling to hold on to her own voice. As the
         dream turns into a nightmare, she must make a choice: lose her big break, or get broken.
        
        Inspired by true events, Muted is a fearless exploration of the dark side of the music industry, the business
         of exploitation, how a girl's dreams can be used against her -- and what it takes to fight back.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

        diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit.

        In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam
         and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another 
         family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, 
         boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her
          diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and
           surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait 
           of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                  another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                   but she is clearly a talented writer.
                  An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                  I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                  the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                  and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                  winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                   she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                   by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                   Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                  Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                  1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                  what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                  2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                  and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                  3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                   will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                   believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                  At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                  one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                   than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                    Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                     exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                     lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                  This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                  ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                   a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                   but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                   funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main 
                   characters and I can’t wait to read more by the author. I read this book in one sitting—very fast paced.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                  h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                  punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                  ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                  We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `Walter Isaacson's "enthralling" (The New Yorker) worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder
         Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews
          with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written
           a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose
            passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, 
            music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a 
            time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness
             and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity 
             with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. 
             Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He
              encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed
               against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry,
                devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.
                
                His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. 
                Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen,
                 and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.`,

                review: `our first bsc graphic novel with new artist gabriela epstein! like with the transition from raina 
                    telgemeier to gale galligan, this transition isn't quite seamless, but is close enough to fool most kids. 
                    the book was just as subtexty (claudia x ashley = clashley) as the source material, but I can't pretend 
                    I wasn't hoping for the gayness to be explicit rather than implied.`,
                hiddenReview: `three notes about the adaptation that are worth mentioning: first, though everyone still 
                    makes fun of ashley's style, she's much more alternative/punk than the described boho style in the original
                     book. secondly, there is one two-page spread where ashley's face is smack dab in the middle of the panel, 
                     so we lose her facial expression (a mistake that, I suspect, epstein will probably not make again). thirdly,
                     in the scene where claud makes rice krispies treats with the rodowskys, the actual recipe is included, which is a really lovely touch!`

                review: `This is one of my favorite books, so I'm happy that the graphic novel is extremely faithful to the
                     source material. I like the character design of Ashley; her edgy style felt like a good update of the 1980s
                      "hippie". I enjoyed the way this brings the story to life. Claudia and Ashley's "finding source material" 
                      montage is funny and relatable, Jackie Rodowsky is sweet and winning, and Ashley's abstract fire hydrant sculpture is cool.`,
                hiddenReview: `I was sort of hoping against hope that the queer subtext in this book would be made text in the update, and it's 
                      not, but it's also not toned down. It includes one of my favorite moments: when Claudia tells Mimi she just met a girl who she 
                      somehow thinks will be a good friend, and Mimi remarks that it happens that way sometimes - it happened that way with Claudia's
                       grandfather. I felt the exact same way when I, at twelve, first met the cool edgy-style artist who would eventually become my 
                       first queer significant other, so that moment/this book was very important to me.`

                review: `Gabriela Epstein had some big shoes to fill, joining the BSC Graphic Novel series nine books in,
                     and I'll be honest, it took me a couple chapters to really warm up to her art. Not that it's a huge departure 
                     from what we've already seen, but it's still a little different and change is scary haha. But her cherubic angel 
                     Jackie Rodowsky won me over, and made me notice how great everyone looks. For some reason, I was especially drawn 
                     to Kristy and Dawn. I'm excited to see the next book she adapts!`,
                hiddenReview: `Story-wise, I enjoyed this. It's been a couple of years since I last read the original (which is embarrassing,
                    since I thought I would get through the whole series in, like, a couple months lmao) but as far as I can tell, it was a
                    pretty faithful adaption. I especially liked the salty BSC eating all her snacks, that was a fun little montage (especially
                    Mary Anne catching the marshmallow thrown by Kristy in her mouth ahhahahaha!!) Oh, and the one panel of all their
                    identical angry faces (except Mary Anne's sympathetic one) cracked me up!I can see this book being just as popular 
                    as the rest of the series, and hope that we get many, many more books. (Hey, Raina and Gale each got four, so it's 
                    only fair for Gaby and Chan Chau (who is adapting the next book) to also each get four. BSC FOREVER!!!)`,

        description: `After a humiliating scandal, a young writer flees to the West Coast to start over, where she is drawn into 
              the morally-ambiguous orbit of a charismatic filmmaker and the teenage girls who are her next subjects.
              Not too long ago, Cass was a promising young playwright in New York, hailed as "a fierce new voice" and "queer, feminist,
               and ready to spill the tea." But at the height of all this attention, Cass finds herself at the center of a searing public 
               shaming, and flees to Los Angeles to escape--and reinvent herself.There she meets her next - door neighbor Caroline, a 
               magnetic filmmaker on the rise, as well as the pack of teenage girls who hang around her house.They are the subjects of 
               Caroline's next semidocumentary movie, which follows the girls' clandestine after - school activity: a Fight Club inspired by
                the violent classic.
              As Cass is drawn into the film's orbit, she is awed by Caroline's drive and confidence.But over time, she becomes troubled by
               how deeply Caroline is manipulating the teens in the name of art--especially as the consequences become increasingly disturbing.
               With her past proving hard to shake and her future one she's no longer sure she wants, Cass is forced to reckon with her own 
               ambitions and confront what she has come to believe about the steep price of success.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

                review: `our first bsc graphic novel with new artist gabriela epstein! like with the transition from raina 
                      telgemeier to gale galligan, this transition isn't quite seamless, but is close enough to fool most kids. 
                      the book was just as subtexty (claudia x ashley = clashley) as the source material, but I can't pretend 
                      I wasn't hoping for the gayness to be explicit rather than implied.`,
                hiddenReview: `three notes about the adaptation that are worth mentioning: first, though everyone still 
                      makes fun of ashley's style, she's much more alternative/punk than the described boho style in the original
                       book. secondly, there is one two-page spread where ashley's face is smack dab in the middle of the panel, 
                       so we lose her facial expression (a mistake that, I suspect, epstein will probably not make again). thirdly,
                       in the scene where claud makes rice krispies treats with the rodowskys, the actual recipe is included, which is a really lovely touch!`

                review: `This is one of my favorite books, so I'm happy that the graphic novel is extremely faithful to the
                       source material. I like the character design of Ashley; her edgy style felt like a good update of the 1980s
                        "hippie". I enjoyed the way this brings the story to life. Claudia and Ashley's "finding source material" 
                        montage is funny and relatable, Jackie Rodowsky is sweet and winning, and Ashley's abstract fire hydrant sculpture is cool.`,
                hiddenReview: `I was sort of hoping against hope that the queer subtext in this book would be made text in the update, and it's 
                        not, but it's also not toned down. It includes one of my favorite moments: when Claudia tells Mimi she just met a girl who she 
                        somehow thinks will be a good friend, and Mimi remarks that it happens that way sometimes - it happened that way with Claudia's
                         grandfather. I felt the exact same way when I, at twelve, first met the cool edgy-style artist who would eventually become my 
                         first queer significant other, so that moment/this book was very important to me.`

                review: `Gabriela Epstein had some big shoes to fill, joining the BSC Graphic Novel series nine books in,
                       and I'll be honest, it took me a couple chapters to really warm up to her art. Not that it's a huge departure 
                       from what we've already seen, but it's still a little different and change is scary haha. But her cherubic angel 
                       Jackie Rodowsky won me over, and made me notice how great everyone looks. For some reason, I was especially drawn 
                       to Kristy and Dawn. I'm excited to see the next book she adapts!`,
                hiddenReview: `Story-wise, I enjoyed this. It's been a couple of years since I last read the original (which is embarrassing,
                      since I thought I would get through the whole series in, like, a couple months lmao) but as far as I can tell, it was a
                      pretty faithful adaption. I especially liked the salty BSC eating all her snacks, that was a fun little montage (especially
                      Mary Anne catching the marshmallow thrown by Kristy in her mouth ahhahahaha!!) Oh, and the one panel of all their
                      identical angry faces (except Mary Anne's sympathetic one) cracked me up!I can see this book being just as popular 
                      as the rest of the series, and hope that we get many, many more books. (Hey, Raina and Gale each got four, so it's 
                      only fair for Gaby and Chan Chau (who is adapting the next book) to also each get four. BSC FOREVER!!!)`,

        description: `A revelatory exploration of fashion through the ages that asks what our clothing reveals
               about ourselves and our society.

              Dress codes are as old as clothing itself. For centuries, clothing has been a wearable status symbol;
               fashion, a weapon in struggles for social change; and dress codes, a way to maintain political control.
                Merchants who dressed like princes and butchers’ wives wearing gem-encrusted crowns were public enemies
                 in medieval societies structured by social hierarchy and defined by spectacle. In Tudor England, silk,
                  velvet, and fur were reserved for the nobility and ballooning pants called “trunk hose” could be considered
                   a menace to good order. The Renaissance era Florentine patriarch Cosimo de Medici captured the power of
                    fashion and dress codes when he remarked, “One can make a gentleman from two yards of red cloth.” Dress
                     codes evolved along with the social and political ideals of the day, but they always reflected struggles
                      for power and status. In the 1700s, South Carolina’s “Negro Act” made it illegal for Black people to dress 
                      “above their condition.” In the 1920s, the bobbed hair and form-fitting dresses worn by free-spirited 
                      flappers were banned in workplaces throughout the United States and in the 1940s the baggy zoot suits 
                      favored by Black and Latino men caused riots in cities from coast to coast.
              
              Even in today’s more informal world, dress codes still determine what we wear, when we wear it—and what our 
              clothing means. People lose their jobs for wearing braided hair, long fingernails, large earrings, beards, and 
              tattoos or refusing to wear a suit and tie or make-up and high heels. In some cities, wearing sagging pants is
               a crime. And even when there are no written rules, implicit dress codes still influence opportunities and social 
               mobility. Silicon Valley CEOs wear t-shirts and flip flops, setting the tone for an entire industry: women wearing
                fashionable dresses or high heels face ridicule in the tech world and some venture capitalists refuse to invest in
                 any company run by someone wearing a suit.
              
              In Dress Codes, law professor and cultural critic Richard Thompson Ford presents an insightful and entertaining
               history of the laws of fashion from the middle ages to the present day, a walk down history’s red carpet to uncover
                and examine the canons, mores, and customs of clothing—rules that we often take for granted. After reading Dress Codes,
                 you’ll never think of fashion as superficial again—and getting dressed will never be the same.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                     but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `The New York Times-bestselling author of Find Me and Call Me by Your Name returns to the essay form with his
               collection of thoughts on time, the creative mind, and great lives and works

              Irrealis moods are the set of verbal moods that indicate that something is not actually the case or a certain situation
               or action is not known to have happened . . .
              
              Andr� Aciman returns to the essay form in Homo Irrealis to explore what the present tense means to artists who cannot
               grasp the here and now. Irrealis is not about the present, or the past, or the future, but about what might have been
                but never was--but could in theory still happen.
              
              From meditations on subway poetry and the temporal resonances of an empty Italian street, to considerations of the lives
               and work of Sigmund Freud, Constantine Cavafy, W. G. Sebald, John Sloan, �ric Rohmer, Marcel Proust, and Fernando Pessoa,
                and portraits of cities such as Alexandria and St. Petersburg, Homo Irrealis is a deep reflection of the imagination's power
                 to shape our memories under time's seemingly intractable hold.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                     but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                     funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                review: `I really don't know how to review this book, I just want to tell everyone to read it and let it sink in. 
                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

               look at the Tulsa Race Massacre, one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our nation's history.
                The book traces the history of African Americans in Tulsa's Greenwood district and chronicles the

              News of what happened was largely suppressed, and no official investigation occurred for seventy-five years.

                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                review: `I really don't know how to review this book, I just want to tell everyone to read it and let it sink in. 
                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `A groundbreaking and endlessly surprising history of how artisans created America, from
               the nation's origins to the present day.

              At the center of the United States' economic and social development, according to conventional wisdom,
               are industry, commodities, and technology-while craftspeople and handmade objects are relegated to a 
               bygone past. Renowned craft historian Glenn Adamson turns that narrative on its head in this innovative 
               account, revealing how makers have always been central to America's identity. Examine any phase of the 
               nation's struggle to define itself, and artisans are there-from the silversmith Paul Revere and the 
               revolutionary carpenters and blacksmiths who hurled tea into Boston Harbor, to today's “craftivists.” 
               From Mother Jones to Rosie the Riveter. From Betsy Ross to the AIDS Quilt.
              
              Adamson documents how craft has long been implicated in debates around inequality, education, and class, 
              as well as America's failures to live up to its loftiest ideals. Yet artisanship has also been a site of 
              resistance for oppressed people, such as enslaved African-Americans whose skilled labor might confer hard-won 
              agency under bondage, or the Native American makers who built traditional arts into businesses that preserved
               cherished folkways. Theirs are among the array of memorable portraits of Americans both celebrated and unfamiliar 
               in this richly peopled book. As Adamson argues, these artisans' stories speak to our collective striving toward
                a more perfect union: from the beginning, America had to be-and still remains to be-crafted. `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:

                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have

                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

        description: `A decade in the making: the first comprehensive look at the life and art of Francis Bacon,
               one of the iconic painters of the twentieth century--from the Pulitzer Prize-winning authors of de Kooning:
                An American Master.

              Francis Bacon created an indelible image of mankind in modern times, and played an outsized role in both 
              twentieth century art and life--from his public emergence with his legendary Triptych 1944 (its images so
                   unrelievedly awful that people fled the gallery), to his death in Madrid in 1992.
              
              Bacon was a witty free spirit and unabashed homosexual at a time when many others remained closeted, and his
               exploits were as unforgettable as his images. He moved among the worlds of London's Soho and East End, the
                literary salons of London and Paris, and the homosexual life of Tangier. Through hundreds of interviews, 
                and extensive new research, the authors probe Bacon's childhood in Ireland (he earned his father's lasting
                 disdain because his asthma prevented him from hunting); his increasingly open homosexuality; his early design 
                 career--never before explored in detail; the formation of his vision; his early failure as an artist; his
                  uneasy relationship with American abstract art; and his improbable late emergence onto the international
                   stage as one of the great visionaries of the twentieth century. In all, Francis Bacon: Revelations gives
                    us a more complete and nuanced--and more international--portrait than ever before of this singularly private,
                     darkly funny, eruptive man and his equally eruptive, extraordinary art. Bacon was not just an influential 
                     artist, he helped remake the twentieth-century figure. `,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                     but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                    writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                    last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                    didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                    The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                    fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                    expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                    late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                    this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                     to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                     own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                     like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                     waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                    One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                    someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                    loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                    a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                    is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                    of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                    the whole book.
                    I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                     better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                     but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                     at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                      more than the ending we get.
                    In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                    I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                    another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                     but she is clearly a talented writer.
                    An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                    and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                     but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                     funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

        description: `Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 2014

              Aged thirteen, Theo Decker, son of a devoted mother and a reckless, largely absent father, survives an accident
               that otherwise tears his life apart. Alone and rudderless in New York, he is taken in by the family of a wealthy
                friend. He is tormented by an unbearable longing for his mother, and down the years clings to the thing that
                 most reminds him of her: a small, strangely captivating painting that ultimately draws him into the criminal
                  underworld. As he grows up, Theo learns to glide between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty antiques
                   store where he works. He is alienated and in love - and his talisman, the painting, places him at the centre
                    of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.
              
              The Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through present-day America and a drama of enthralling power. Combining
               unforgettably vivid characters and thrilling suspense, it is a beautiful, addictive triumph - a sweeping story
                of loss and obsession, of survival and self-invention, of the deepest mysteries of love, identity and fate.`,

                    I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                    the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling,

                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                    winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                     she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                     by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                     Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                    Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                    1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                    what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                    2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                    and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                    3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                     will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                     believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                    At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                    one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                     than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                      Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                       exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                       lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                    This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                    ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                     a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                    In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                    about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                    place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                    chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                    masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                    goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,
                hiddenReview: `Being a playwright is possibly the most permanent aspect of the entire field, and that’s what Cass plies at for
                     10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                      play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                       finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                       on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                       in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                       long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                       morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                       and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                        most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                        ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                        but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                        compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                        at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                        uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                        We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                        things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                        it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                        enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                        on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                         this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                review: `I really don't know how to review this book, I just want to tell everyone to read it and let it sink in. 
                    Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better 
                    h word for brutal I would use it, but I don't think any could fit what I'm trying to say as well. This book is a 
                    punch in your face, with scenes that make you gasp and, again, honest portrayals of those in the theatre and film world. 
                    We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold 
                    ourselves to, our definitions of success, and the pitfalls of going after something so hard you lose sight of what's real. 
                    We Play Ourselves is an unforgettable read.`

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                  writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                  last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                  didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                  The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                  fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                  expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                  late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                  this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                   to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                   own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                   like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                   waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                  One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                  someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                  loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                  a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                  is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                  of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                  the whole book.
                  I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                   better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                   but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                   at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                    more than the ending we get.
                  In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                  I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read

                review: `I was interested in reading this because I really enjoyed Silverman’s debut short story collection. 
                  In long form she doesn’t disappoint. This is a book about find oneself…not, not quite right, this is a book 
                  about finding equanimity within yourself, an ability to be at peace with your place in the world, even if that 
                  place isn’t what you had planned for or imagined. But first…adventures and obstacles. And Cass, the protagonist, 
                  chooses a road fraught with the latter, because she decides to dedicate herself to theatre. One of the most 
                  masochistic career choices out there, the most arrogant and least permanent of the arts. Plays, the ultimate 
                  goal of it all, are the castles in the sand of the art world, admired by a few for a short time and promptly vanished.`,

                   10 long years until a major boon of an award and cash prize elevates her on a new level and allows her to have a
                    play produced properly with a well known director and lead actress. Cass is determined to make the best of it, but
                     finds herself in love with her director and sleeping with her star and constantly surpassed by a fellow prize winner 
                     on the success ladder. And then the reviews come out…So onto the second act, for this is a classic three act play 
                     in itself. Reinvention. Cass is now in LA, staying with a friend, witness to the slow dissolution of his seven year 
                     long relationship. In a theatre world and world at large Cass is now a persona non grata with social media’s public 
                     morality never letting her forget her sins. Cass meets a neighbor who is directing an all girl version of Fight Club 
                     and gets involved in that, but eventually finds out that movies are just another imperfect art form, less real than
                      most, and rife with lying liars. Third act…Cass goes back to the small town she has so eagerly left so many years 
                      ago to stay with her parents and figure out what’s next. Tries to find some peace in small scale pretense free life, 
                      but much like art, in some form or another it is everywhere. So there you go, a faulty and flawed, but surprisingly 
                      compelling narrator stumbling through life in that very millennial specific way of desperately trying to be an artist 
                      at all costs. But, because Silverman is such a great writer, this book never become an ode to millennial wishywashy 
                      uncertainty and immaturity, instead it goes further to mediate on the very nature of choices and authenticity. 
                      We play ourselves in life, for different people, on different stages, often until we forget the really important 
                      things, the permanent things, the things that matter. For me, that’s what the book was about and overwhelmingly 
                      it succeeded. Certainly I enjoyed reading it way more than most millennial adventures out there. Interestingly 
                      enough, the author is a playwright herself, so it’s impossible not to think of how much of her is in Cass and so 
                      on, but then again, she seems to have made it, unlike her protagonist, but then again…the odds, the odds. Liked
                       this book very much. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley.`

                  Jen Silverman's We Play Ourselves is honest, brutal, hilarious, and heartbreaking all at once. If I knew a better

                  We Play Ourselves covers art, sexuality, self discovery, coming of age, and then some. It's about the measures we hold

        description: `A short, powerful, illustrated book written by Khaled Hosseini in response to the current refugee crisis,
           Sea Prayer is composed in the form of a letter, from a father to his son, on the eve of their journey. Watching over his
            sleeping son, the father reflects on the dangerous sea-crossing that lies before them. It is also a vivid portrait of
             their life in Homs, Syria, before the war, and of that city's swift transformation from a home into a deadly war zone.

          Impelled to write this story by the haunting image of young Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed
           upon the beach in Turkey in September 2015, Hosseini hopes to pay tribute to the millions of families, like Kurdi's,
            who have been splintered and forced from home by war and persecution, and he will donate author proceeds from this book
             to the UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency) and The Khaled Hosseini Foundation to help fund lifesaving relief efforts to help 
             refugees around the globe. Hosseini is also a Goodwill Envoy to the UNHCR, and the founder of The Khaled Hosseini Foundation,
              a nonprofit that provides humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.`,

                review: `This was interesting. In the end I don’t think that this book was for me, but I did really like the author’s 
                writing style. The way Silverman writes, got me through a book that I might have really struggled with otherwise. The 
                last two books I’ve read in a row, I have had similar experiences with. The book I reviewed right before this one, I 
                didn’t enjoy and it was my own fault for misreading the blurb. With this book, I actually did not misread anything. 
                The book blurb makes you think that this book is in a certain genre, which it is not. This is contemporary or literary 
                fiction, and is not a thriller with a mystery twist that the blurb leads you to believe. The blurb gave me certain 
                expectations, that the book just could not meet, and I don’t think that is fair to the author. I know it may be too 
                late, with the book coming out in only two days, but I would change the blurb so readers are not disappointed and so 
                this book will be targeted to the right audience.`,
                hiddenReview: `This is a first person story about Cass, a playwright, who flees to L.A. after a scandal of her own making. Cass wants
                 to reinvent herself and gets sucked into the world of indie moviemaking about a group of teenage girls who have their 
                 own “Fight Club”. We get to see, through flashbacks, Cass success as a playwright, her downfall, and what her life is 
                 like now in L.A. in present time. It’s an odd premise for sure, and the story gets even weirder as you read it. I kept 
                 waiting for the mystery/thriller part to happen and was left scratching my head wondering “what am I reading?” when it didn’t.
                One of the issues I had was that Cass is not the easiest character to like. It’s tough being in first person POV with 
                someone you are struggling to connect with. She can be very self-centered, jealous, has a real woe is me attitude, and 
                loves to run when anything gets tough. I don’t know that I can say if she ever really grew in the end, but I did find her 
                a little more palatable as the book went on. Her relationship with one of the teenagers named BB –Cass is bisexual and BB 
                is queer, so they seemed to bond over that plus Cass just knew how to really talk to BB- these scenes ended up being some 
                of my favorite. They showed Cass in a better light and the character of BB really was the most interesting character of 
                the whole book.
                I have to mention that I’m a bit disappointed in the end. Maybe it is just not that kind of book, but I really wanted some
                 better closure. Towards the end Cass seemed to be doing better, she was making amends to people and sticking up for herself, 
                 but then she fell into an old bad habit, which seemed to stop any growth I thought was happening. You see a spark of something 
                 at the end, but I was left saying “that’s it?” I feel like I spent a good amount of time on this book and I needed something
                  more than the ending we get.
                In the end, this was not the book I thought I was getting and I had a few issues that were pretty big. On the goods side, 
                I really liked Silverman’s writing. This sounds a little weird, but her writing style felt good to read. I would read 
                another book by her in a heartbeat, just to have more of that good reading feel. I wasn’t crazy about some of her story choices,
                 but she is clearly a talented writer.
                An ARC was given to me for a honest review.`

                review: `There is so much in this book that I'm not sure how to begin talking about it, and what exactly it was that 
                I loved about it. I'm worried that merely describing the plot won't make it sound as good as it actually is, because
                the language really makes it sizzle, and Silverman writes about complicated emotions in a style I found thrilling, 
                and those things are difficult to communicate in a review.`,
                hiddenReview: `Cass is a 33-year-old playwright who's had a tumultuous few months: after years of work, she's finally attained success, 
                winning a coveted award – but this is swiftly followed by a spectacular downfall. Fleeing the fallout of a scandal in New York,
                 she hides out at her friend’s house in Silver Lake, LA. While she tries to keep a low profile, she can't help being intrigued 
                 by her new next-door neighbour Caroline, a flighty, charismatic filmmaker. It isn't long before she gets caught up in 
                 Caroline's latest project, a documentary about a group of teen girls who organise violent gatherings inspired by Fight Club.
                Here are three particular things about We Play Ourselves that I can't stop thinking about:
                1. Cass's unrequited love for Hélène, the director of her play. It's just such a great portrayal of what it means, 
                what it is, to feel like this about someone – painfully dead-on and, if you've experienced it yourself, exceptionally validating.
                2. The scene wherein Cass is finally reunited with her nemesis, wunderkind Tara-Jean Slater. Odd and sparse and dreamy 
                and lonely; a Hollywood hallucination.
                3. The penultimate chapter!! I don't want to describe it because that would spoil the experience of reading it, but I
                 will say this: if, after reading the first chapter, I had flipped forward and read the penultimate one, I would never have 
                 believed that both could have come from the same book. It's a tour de force in itself, and has to be read to be believed.
                At first, I much preferred the New York flashbacks, which reminded me strongly – in language and in spirit – of Sweetbitter, 
                one of my favourite books. I'll admit I found the LA plot less compelling, and Caroline and the teens less interesting characters
                 than Cass, Hélène and Tara-Jean. But when the narratives eventually converge, everything slots together marvellously. I think
                  Cass's realisations about what's important in her life – what 'success' actually means, and whether it matters at all – are
                   exactly what many of us need to read in this era of uncertainty, when so many people have seen their professional and personal 
                   lives stymied by the effects of the pandemic. They certainly helped me. 
                This novel is a fizzing ball of ideas, a delightfully messy multilayered exploration of queerness and desire, art and 
                ambition, and what it means to fail (or not). 'A strange miracle', as someone tells Cass. I adored Cass's voice and found
                 a great deal to love about the story.   I received an advance review copy of We Play Ourselves from the publisher through Edelweiss.`

                 but this book was a refreshingly honest portrayal of second chances and accepting who you are. This book was 
                 funny, poignant, and brutally accurate. I loved the social dynamics between the relationships of the main
